Basic Features:

User should be able to search for bus timings based on bus stop.

Additional Features:

- User should be able to see a list of bus stops that's near him based on his geolocation.
- User should be able to select a favorite bus service(for a bus stop) and favorite bus stops.

- On the Nearby screen, users should be able to see his location on a map and be able to see bus stops that are available on a map. From there, user can select the bus stop and get the bus timings
